First issue: Took me about five days to make this, I used this as a pastime during the boring training lectures.
             Worked on it when I felt like, about two hours a day would be my guess, though not consistently...

 >> a bug, fixed same day  9:46 PM, 07-09-2021 ::
           due to incomplete formulae without any added exception
           in case the ball launched horizontally
           the tangent calculated was infinity and hence target y be 0
           so computer always went to far top on simple horizontal shot
